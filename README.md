CPSC 4370 Fraud Analysis AI Project

The Goal
To determine possible fraudent activities from financial PCA datasets 

The Challenge
Using Python and machine learning, generate program that determines probabilities of fraudulent transactions automatically using Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier models

Running the project within any Python supported IDE:
Step one is to run "testcsvconnection.py" to ensure your environment is setup correctly and ready to execute.

Step two is run main.py which will show four pop ups one at a time. The first two are the datasets being prepared for use, 
and the last two pop ups are the confusion matrix visualization outputs for each model after being trained on the same datasets
